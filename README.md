# RPi Cam MP4Boxer
Shell script for converting .h264 files into .mp4, also known as mp4 boxing. Originally created for [RPi Cam Web Interface](https://github.com/silvanmelchior/RPi_Cam_Web_Interface).

## Original idea
Converts all .h264 files inside a folder to .mp4, defaults are for RPi Cam Web Interface defaults, but you could modify the code to point to any folder.
